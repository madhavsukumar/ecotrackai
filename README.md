# EcoTrack AI 🌱

EcoTrack AI is a web-based prototype that helps users estimate their carbon footprint based on daily spending categories.  
The goal of the project is to create awareness about the environmental impact of everyday financial decisions in a simple and user-friendly way.

This project was developed during a 36-hour online hackathon by first-year Computer Science students.

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Individuals want to reduce their carbon footprint but lack visibility into how everyday purchases contribute to environmental impact.  
Manual tracking is difficult, inaccurate, and not sustainable.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
EcoTrack AI allows users to:
- Enter an expense amount
- Select a spending category (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.)
- Instantly view an estimated carbon footprint
- Receive simple suggestions to reduce environmental impact

The focus is on **simplicity, accessibility, and awareness**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GitHub  
- Vercel (for deployment)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User selects a category and enters an expense amount
2. Predefined emission factors are applied
3. Carbon footprint is calculated on the client side
4. Result is displayed instantly on the screen

---

## 📌 Assumptions
- Carbon emission values are approximate and used for demonstration purposes
